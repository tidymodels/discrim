`discrim` contains simple bindings to enable the `parsnip` package to
fit various discriminant analysis models, such as

-   Linear discriminant analysis (LDA, simple and regularized)
-   Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA, simple and regularized)
-   Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA, via [Friedman
    (1989)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C7&q=%22Regularized+Discriminant+Analysis%22&btnG=))
-   Flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) using MARS features
-   Naive Bayes models

## Installation

You can install the released version of discrim from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("discrim")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/discrim")
```

## Available Engines

The discrim package provides engines for the models in the following
table.

| model               | engine        | mode           |
|:--------------------|:--------------|:---------------|
| discrim_flexible    | earth         | classification |
| discrim_linear      | MASS          | classification |
| discrim_linear      | mda           | classification |
| discrim_linear      | sda           | classification |
| discrim_linear      | sparsediscrim | classification |
| discrim_quad        | MASS          | classification |
| discrim_quad        | sparsediscrim | classification |
| discrim_regularized | klaR          | classification |
| naive_Bayes         | klaR          | classification |
| naive_Bayes         | naivebayes    | classification |

## Example

Here is a simple model using a simulated two-class data set contained in
the package:

``` r
library(discrim)

parabolic_grid <-
  expand.grid(X1 = seq(-5, 5, length = 100),
              X2 = seq(-5, 5, length = 100))

fda_mod <-
  discrim_flexible(num_terms = 3) %>%
  # increase `num_terms` to find smoother boundaries
  set_engine("earth") %>%
  fit(class ~ ., data = parabolic)

parabolic_grid$fda <-
  predict(fda_mod, parabolic_grid, type = "prob")$.pred_Class1

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(parabolic, aes(x = X1, y = X2)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = class), alpha = .5) +
  geom_contour(data = parabolic_grid, aes(z = fda), col = "black", breaks = .5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  coord_equal()
```
