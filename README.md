`discrim` contains simple bindings to enable the `parsnip` package to
fit various discriminant analysis models, such as

- Linear discriminant analysis (LDA, simple and regularized)
- Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA, simple and regularized)
- Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA, via [Friedman
  (1989)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C7&q=%22Regularized+Discriminant+Analysis%22&btnG=))
- Flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) using MARS features
- Naive Bayes models

## Installation

You can install the released version of discrim from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("discrim")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/discrim")
```

## Available Engines

The discrim package provides engines for the models in the following
table.

| model               | engine        | mode           |
|:--------------------|:--------------|:---------------|
| discrim_flexible    | earth         | classification |
| discrim_linear      | MASS          | classification |
| discrim_linear      | mda           | classification |
| discrim_linear      | sda           | classification |
| discrim_linear      | sparsediscrim | classification |
| discrim_quad        | MASS          | classification |
| discrim_quad        | sparsediscrim | classification |
| discrim_regularized | klaR          | classification |
| naive_Bayes         | klaR          | classification |
| naive_Bayes         | naivebayes    | classification |

## Example

Here is a simple model using a simulated two-class data set contained in
the package:

``` r
library(discrim)

parabolic_grid <-
  expand.grid(X1 = seq(-5, 5, length = 100),
              X2 = seq(-5, 5, length = 100))

fda_mod <-
  discrim_flexible(num_terms = 3) %>%
  # increase `num_terms` to find smoother boundaries
  set_engine("earth") %>%
  fit(class ~ ., data = parabolic)

parabolic_grid$fda <-
  predict(fda_mod, parabolic_grid, type = "prob")$.pred_Class1

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(parabolic, aes(x = X1, y = X2)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = class), alpha = .5) +
  geom_contour(data = parabolic_grid, aes(z = fda), col = "black", breaks = .5) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  coord_equal()
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-1.png" alt="Scatter chart. X1 along the x-axis, X2 along the y-axis. points are scattered, with a trend between X1 and X2. Most of the middle points are colored and labeled Class2, with the remaining points labeled Class1. Two connected straight lines, doing its best to separate the two classes." width="100%" />
