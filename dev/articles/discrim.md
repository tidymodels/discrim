# Introduction to discrim

As an example, we’ll use a *flexible discriminant analysis* model of
Hastie, Tibshirani, and Buja (1994). This fits a model that uses
features generated by the multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS)
model of Friedman (1991). It is able to create class boundaries that are
polygons and has built-in feature selection.

The `parabolic` data from the modeldata package will be used to
illustrate:

``` r
library(tidymodels)
library(discrim)
tidymodels_prefer()
theme_set(theme_bw())

data(parabolic, package = "modeldata")
```

To create the model, the \[discrim_flexible()\] function is used along
with an engine of `"earth"` (which contains the methods to use the MARS
model). We’ll set the number of MARS terms to use but this can be tuned
via the methods in the tune package.

The [`fit()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/fit.html) function
estimates the model.
[`fit_xy()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/fit_xy.html) can be
used if one does not wish to use the formula method.

``` r
fda_mod <-
  discrim_flexible(num_terms = 3) |>
  # increase `num_terms` to find smoother boundaries
  set_engine("earth") |>
  fit(class ~ ., data = parabolic)
fda_mod
```

    ##     nprune = ~3)

Now let’s plot the class boundary by predicting on a grid of points then
creating a contour plot for the 50% probability cutoff.

``` r
parabolic_grid <-
  expand.grid(X1 = seq(-5, 5, length = 100),
              X2 = seq(-5, 5, length = 100))

parabolic_grid <- 
  parabolic_grid |> 
  bind_cols(
    predict(fda_mod, parabolic_grid, type = "prob")
  )

ggplot(parabolic, aes(x = X1, y = X2)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = class), alpha = .5) +
  geom_contour(data = parabolic_grid, aes(z = .pred_Class1), col = "black", breaks = .5) +
  coord_equal()
```

![Scatter chart. X1 along the x-axis, X2 along the y-axis. points are
scattered, with a trend between X1 and X2. Most of the middle points are
colored and labeled Class2, with the remaining points labeled Class1.
